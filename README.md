OC-FLOW is an “hands-free” earthquake location workflow to process continuous seismic records: from raw waveforms to well located earthqu    akes with magnitude calculations. The package assembles several popular routines for sequential earthquake location refinements, suitable     for catalog building ranging from local to regional scales.
